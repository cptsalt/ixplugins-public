## Public Plugins

This is a repository of plugins I made a long time ago (or recently) and decided to release to the public.

I cannot promise any of this works, as I haven't tested any of it since 2021, but I can guarantee that all of it has worked at one point.

I will not make any promises to provide technical support for these plugins, as I haven't developed them in a very long time.
